title: Introduction
---

This course is designed to take you from having no knowledge of systems management by using Apache Mesos, to automatically building and deploying a complete cluster running Apache Mesos, Marathon, Mesos DNS, Chronos, Docker and Ansible.  This course is designed so that even if you don't know anything about the tools, you'll become familiar by completing the examples and exercises.  If you've always wanted to understand modern cloud infrastructure then this course is for you!

This course assumes that you have basic knowledge of managing a Linux system and are proficient in Unix command line tools. A minimum of 8G of RAM is required on your system.

The exercises are structured as follows:

1. An introductory section that describes the exercise.
2. A video lecture that introduces the topic and teaches the subject.
3. Hands-on checkpoints to complete the exercise.
4. References for further study on related topics.
5. A Disqus comments section.


The exercises are designed to take between 15-60 minutes, and the entire course should take only a few days to complete.

How To Complete This Course
===========================

The exercises have a consistent format that is designed to teach and act as a reference for further study.  The format is:

1. An introduction that explains the exercise, its goals, and any prerequisites you may need.
2. A video lecture that teaches you the lesson, usually with a demonstration for you to watch
   and take notes about, or a presentation of information, or both.
3. A quick reference section that will have links mentioned in the videos, and list the commands
   used for you to refer to later.  The commands are usually given in "shell friendly" format so you
   can copy and paste them when trying to replicate what the video did, although you should type them so
   you get used to working with the tools.
4. Homework for you to do before moving on.  The homework should be short and related to the lecture, but
   it might involve more work depending on your skills and what's necessary for the exercise.

To complete the course you simply start at Exercise 1 and do each exercise in
order, watching the lectures and completing the homework.  When you're done
you'll have a very solid understanding of everything in the Mesos and should be able to
build your own deployments and applications with it.


Getting Help
============

To keep thing simple, please stick to the 7.0 version of CentOS being used in the exercises.  While you may have a more preferred version of Linux, educational goals mean we have to standardize on one and use that to teach.  After you complete the course you should be able to extrapolate this information to any version of Linux you prefer.
