Mesos makes it easy to develop distributed systems by providing
high-level building blocks like resource allocation and process
monitoring. It has APIs for C/C++, Python, Go, Java, and other
JVM languages. Here are some resources to help you get started with
developing on Mesos.

### [Mesos Architecture](https://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/mesos-architecture)

Provides an overview of Mesos concepts.

### [C++ Framework Development Guide](https://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/app-framework-development-guide/)

Get started with writing Mesos applications in C++.

### [Go Bindings and Examples](https://github.com/mesosphere/mesos-go)

Go language bindings for Apache Mesos, along with an example scheduler and executor.

### [Mesos Framework giter8 Template](https://github.com/mesosphere/scala-sbt-mesos-framework.g8)

This is a giter8 template. The result of applying this template is a bare-bones Apache Mesos framework in Scala using SBT for builds and Vagrant for testing on a singleton cluster.

### [Mesos Hello World in Scala](https://gist.github.com/guenter/7471695)

A simple Mesos "Hello World": downloads and starts a web server on every node in the cluster.
