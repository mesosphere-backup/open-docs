title: Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition Privacy Policy
---

We at Mesosphere know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By using or accessing the Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.

Remember that your use of Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition is at all times subject to the DCOS Community Edition License Agreement (the “Agreement”).  Any conflicting provisions will be governed by the Agreement.  Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Agreement.

## What does this Privacy Policy cover?

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we may gather when you are accessing or using our Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We may gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition, including to provide and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at support@mesosphere.io.

## Will Mesosphere ever change this Privacy Policy?

We’re continually trying to improve Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on Mesosphere.io, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.

## What Information does Mesosphere Collect?

### Information You Provide to Us:

We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for third party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition is covered by this Privacy Policy. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.

We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of our or other businesses, or email you about your use of the Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by emailing us at support@mesosphere.io.

For avoidance of doubt, Mesosphere does not expect or desire to receive your confidential business information.  As such, in the absence of a separate written agreement, we may reasonably presume that any information received from you is not confidential business information and if we learn that we have collected confidential business information from you, we will delete such information as quickly as possible.


### Information Collected Automatically

Whenever you interact with our Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition, we automatically receive and record information from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition, and the feature you are using. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. If you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices.

When we collect the usage information described above, we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition, and we can use that knowledge to make the Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition interesting to as many users as possible.

## Will Mesosphere Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?

We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, we may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:

#### Information that’s no longer personally identifiable:

We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual.

#### Affiliated Businesses:

In certain situations, businesses or third parties we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.

#### Agents:

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

#### Business Transfers:
We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.

#### Protection of Mesosphere and Others:
We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Agreement and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Mesosphere, our employees, our users, or others.

## Is Personal Information about me secure?

Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.

## What Personal Information can I access?

Through your email address, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete some information you’ve provided to us.  The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the features and capabilities of our website or the Mesosphere DCOS Community Edition change. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at support@mesosphere.io.

Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to: support@mesosphere.io.

## What choices do I have?

You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to use some of our features.

You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You may request deletion of your account by sending an email to support@mesosphere.io. Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.

## What if I have questions about this policy?

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to support@mesosphere.io, and we will try to resolve your concerns.
