Welcome to the Mesosphere Community Documentation website! This site contains documentation and tutorials for the community projects supported by Mesosphere, including [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/), [Marathon](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon) and [Chronos](https://github.com/mesos/chronos).

This site also contains [a listing of Apache Mesos packages by version](/downloads/mesos). These are also available through your distribution's package manager ([setup instructions](https://mesosphere.com/downloads/)).

For product documentation related to [Mesosphere's DCOS](https://mesosphere.com/learn/), please see the [Mesosphere documentation](http://docs.mesosphere.com).


## Getting Started

The best way to start learning about Mesos and the other open source components that make up the Mesosphere DCOS is to take our extensive [Advanced Mesos Course](/advanced-course/) course which teaches you everything you need to run Mesosphere's software.  This course consists of 20 exercises with video, quick reference commands, further study, and online live help comments.  The course takes you from nothing to running a four node cluster running Mesos, Marathon, Chronos, all built automatically with Ansible.  Take it at your own pace, and if you have any questions simply ask in the comments and we'll help you.
